# Vehicle_Detection_using_Yolo
The objective of the "Vehicle Detection using YOLO" project is to create a real-time vehicle detection system using the YOLO algorithm. This system aims to accurately detect vehicles in various conditions, achieve real-time performance, and offer user-friendly customization options for different applications.

**Features**
Real-time vehicle detection in video .  
High accuracy in detecting various vehicles , persons and traffic signals .
Easily customizable for different datasets like video and image format

**Dataset**
The dataset contains media of cars in all views, and your job is to create an algorithm to detect them!
